# Lessons Learned

	Oh boy. I started off by creating the Foodtruck class. It seemed pretty straight forward. 
	I did have to go back and reformat a few things. Then, I created the methods for the user menu, to find the average, and to find the highest rating. This was mostly review of week 1. I did have to reference week one material for a refresher. But all in all, pretty smooth. I stuggled with the week 2 material. I created the get getTruck method and really had a hard time getting the syntax correct. I found myself using a lot of google searches and a LOT of TA help. 

	My take away was I need to spend more time throughout the week rereading the material. I find myself fully understanding the concepts during lecture. However, I don't seem to be retaining the info as well as I would like. When it came time to implement the weeks lessons I stuggled.
